Hi everyone, welcome to the weenoisemaker.com!

Wee Noise Maker is a project I started about 5 years ago with the initial goal
of making an open-source pocket sampler/synthesizer a la Teenage Engineering
Pocket Operator. Since then I made many different prototypes and other
synthesisers projects. I am starting this blog to document some of my
experiments, share my progress, and what I learn in the process.
