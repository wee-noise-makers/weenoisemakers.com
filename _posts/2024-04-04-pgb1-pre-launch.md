We are starting today the pre-launch phase of our crowdfunding campaign for the
PGB-1!

PGB-1 is an all-in-one open-source pocket groovebox I have been working on for
quite some time now. The design, specifications, and firmware evolved quite a
lot since the first prototype, and over the last few months I started to
realize that the project was becoming a really nice piece of gear. So my 2024
new year resolution was to try to launch a crowdfunding campaign for this
project.

We are now at the first phase of the campaign, pre-launch, where we start to
tease the project and try to gather some interest before we go live. Please
sign-up on the [CrowdSupply
page](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wee-noise-makers/wee-noise-makers-pgb-1) to
be notified when the campaign starts.
