We are happy to announce that the PGB-1 crowdfunding campaign is now [live on
Crowd
Supply!](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wee-noise-makers/wee-noise-makers-pgb-1)
This marks the beginning of an exciting journey, and we invite you to be a part
of it from the start.

The PGB-1 is designed to be an intuitive and powerful tool for musicians of all
levels. As a compact, feature-rich groovebox, it allows you to sketch musical
ideas, create beats, and build tracks on-the-go. The PGB-1 features a versatile
range of synth engines, drum machines, and sequencers all housed within a
pocket-size form.

Our campaign will run through to the end of May 2024, with regular updates each
week to keep you informed and involved in the process.

As a special thank you to early backers, we're offering an exclusive early bird
special for the first 20 orders. Check out [our
project](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wee-noise-makers/wee-noise-makers-pgb-1)
