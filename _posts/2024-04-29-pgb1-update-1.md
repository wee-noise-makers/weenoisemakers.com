Hello, we first want to thank everyone for your amazing initial response!
Funding is well underway, and we got amazing feedback at the SynthFest France
event last week.

Over the next few weeks, we'll be releasing a series of updates on the project
page focusing on specific features or design aspects of the PGB-1. In this
update, we'll cover the basic sequencing features of the PGB-1 in video.

If want to ask a questions on this topic or anything else, there are several
ways to do so. You can [comment on the video](https://youtu.be/AgoLAc309mo),
use the [campaign question
form](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wee-noise-makers/wee-noise-makers-pgb-1/ask-question),
join the [Wee Noise Makers Discord Server](https://discord.gg/EAmAgsmV5V), or
contact us on [social media](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wee-noise-makers).

Meanwhile, don't hesitate to talk about the PGB-1 around you, it's a great way
to help the campaign. There's still plenty of time to [back the
project](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wee-noise-makers/wee-noise-makers-pgb-1)!
