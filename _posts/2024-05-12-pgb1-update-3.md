We are happy to announce the first version of the C/C++ software development
kit for the PGB-1.

You can can find the [GitHub repository
here](https://github.com/wee-noise-makers/noise-nugget-c-sdk/) and the [online
documentation here](https://wee-noise-makers.github.io/noise-nugget-c-sdk/).

The SDK provides easy access to the hardware features of the PGB-1 such as the
LEDs, keyboard, OLED screen, MIDI input and, of course, the audio input and
output.

We also include in the SDK an example project which is based on the C++
source code of the Braids Eurorack module from Mutable Instrument.

Here's a quick video with an overview of the SDK and a demo of the Braids
example project:
