I am running a crowdfunding campaign for an [open-source pocket digital
groovebox called the
PGB-1](https://www.crowdsupply.com/wee-noise-makers/wee-noise-makers-pgb-1).
It's an all-in-one instrument, that means you can program and play songs only
using this device and nothing else ([see the demo
here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG0A5TpnFIk)).

PGB-1 is based on the RaspberryPi RP2040 microcontroller, with software
development kits available for
[C/C++](https://github.com/wee-noise-makers/noise-nugget-c-sdk),
[CircuitPython](https://github.com/wee-noise-makers/circuitpython/tree/pgb1-support/ports/raspberrypi/boards/weenoisemakers_pgb1),
and [Ada](https://github.com/wee-noise-makers/noise-nugget-ada-sdk) (Rust is on
the TODO list). The stock firmware I will describe in this post is fully
implemented in Ada. Let me walk you through the design.

# The Two Main Components

At the Firmware level, PGB-1 is made of two main components: the sequencer and
the synthesizer. Early in development I decided to keep them as isolated as
possible.

Inside the PGB-1 firmware, the sequencer and synthesizer only talk via [MIDI
messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI).

Keeping those two components isolated and only communicating through a standard
protocol has great benefits in terms of development and maintenance as they can
be modified and tested independently. But there are other benefits to this
approach.

First, it means easy integration with external gear. The PGB-1 can sequence up
to 16 external instruments, or its internal instruments can be played with an
external MIDI keyboard or another sequencer. This opens up a lot of different
use cases.

Second, this architecture is a great match for the RP2040 dual core
microcontroller. Digital synthesis is a CPU intensive and hard real-time task.
By dedicating a CPU core solely to this task, we can achieve great performance
and simplify the timing requirements.

One drawback of this approach is the limitation of the MIDI protocol, with its
data values of only 7-bits. In my opinion, the benefits listed above clearly
outweigh the limitations.

The RP2040 Core0 is not only running the sequencer, there is also the user
interface (LEDs, keyboard and OLED screen). Still, at this point Core0 is not
fully loaded, we have room for more...

# The Audio Path

Still missing in this picture is the audio path, and this is where it gets
complicated. There are 10 audio sources on the PGB-1, 8 internal digital synth
voices, audio line input, and microphone. All these can run through a mixer
with 4 global effects (Reverb, Overdrive, Filter, and Bitcrusher) and a bypass
(no effect, clean signal).

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![](/assets/pgb-1/PGB-1-soft-design-4.png){: width="70%" }
{: refdef}

On the synthesis side, the incoming MIDI messages are sent to one of the
synthesis engines depending on the MIDI channel ID. Each engine will then
generate a fixed sized mono audio buffer. The mono buffers are then passed
through stereo spanning blocks that will place the sound more or less on the
right or left side depending on track setting (also controlled from MIDI),
resulting in 8 stereo buffers.

These 8 stereo buffers are then dispatched into one of the 5 FX send stereo
buffers given the FX settings for each track.

At this point the job of core1 is over, the FX send buffers are sent to core0
for FX processing and final mix.

{: refdef}

Back on core0, audio buffers coming from the microphone and line inputs are
also dispatched into one of the of FX buffers. This means users can add reverb
or another effect to the incoming signal.

Now it's time for the actual FX processing that modifies the buffers in place,
and finally the very last operation of mixing all the 5 stereo FX buffers
together to produce the output stereo buffer.

This picture above is still a simplified view, I skipped the various queues for
MIDI messages and buffers, interrupts, periodic tasks, and other
synchronization mechanisms. But it should give you an idea of what it takes to
push the rp2040 to its limits and deliver a very powerful instrument in a small
and affordable package.

Meanwhile, don't hesitate to talk about the PGB-1 with people around you; it's
a great way to help the campaign. There's still plenty of time to [back the
