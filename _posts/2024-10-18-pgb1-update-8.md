In this update we are happy to report the completion of the PGB-1 production
prototype!

Modulo some minor design details to iron out (especially on the front panel),
we have a fully designed and working PGB-1 hardware ready for production.

For this final step of the design we worked with [PCBway](http://pcbway.com) to
bring a great addition to the PGB-1. A high quality rubber keypad.

Until now we were using individual 3D printed keys for each of the PGB-1
buttons. This is an ok solution, but the individual keys rattle in, and
pressing the key results in a relatively loud clicking sound. This rubber
keypad is really pushing the feeling of PGB-1 to the next level, and we are
grateful for this collaboration with PCBWay.

For this prototype of the keypad, we use PCBWay's vacuum casting service that
is much cheaper than injection molding and unlocks material that cannot be
manufactured in other ways, such as rubber.

So here are the production prototypes in limited golden aluminum and black
plastic:

As you can see PGB-1 got significantly thinner and a little bit smaller. This
is thanks to the new battery we are using as well as slightly thinner walls on
the case. Weight of the aluminum version is 155g, and 90g for the plastic one.

Overall we are extremely happy with the result, as this is the kind of quality
we had in mind when starting this crowdfunding campaign.

Don't forget that PGB-1 pre-orders are [available on
