# Production Update! (Feb 04, 2025)

This update is a bit bittersweet for us. Production started pretty well, and we
are extremely happy with the end quality of PGB-1. However, we have hit our
first roadblock..

First, the assembly is taking a lot more time than anticipated. We tried as
much as possible to make the PGB-1 easy to assemble, but little things add up,
and in the end, it's quite time consuming.

Then we decided to make a new version of the front panel to improve
electrostatic discharge protection. The electronic circuit is already
protected, but there were instances where the device would reset and we want to
avoid this as much as possible.

The last point, and maybe the most impactful, is Electromagnetic Compatibility
(EMC) testing. The testing took way more time than anticipated and the result
shows a little incompatibility. We are running a new test with a slightly
different configuration and we hope it will fix the issue. If that's not the
case, we might have to produce a new version of the Noise Nugget board, which
would, of course, further increase the delivery delay.

All of this will set us back 3 to 4 weeks. We'll keep you updated here, of
course, and you can also join the [Discord
server](https://discord.gg/EAmAgsmV5V), where we share quick updates from
time to time.

# EMC News and Software Update (Mar 11, 2025)

In our last update, we shared that we were tackling an EMC testing challenge
and awaiting results from a new test with a different software configuration.
Unfortunately, the latest results still aren't where they need to be.

To ensure the PGB-1 meets EMC requirements, we're making a necessary revision
to the electronics. While this means additional costs on our end and a longer
wait for you.

On the positive side, thanks to the modular PGB-1 design, we only have to make
a new version of a relatively small part: the Noise Nugget module. Samples of
the new design are already in production and we will send the samples for
testing as soon as possible.

This does push our timeline back by another 4 to 6 weeks of delay, but we're
moving as quickly as we can and will keep you updated on the progress here on
Crowd Supply and on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/EAmAgsmV5V).

In the meantime, we've been making exciting progress on the software! Stock
firmware version 1.0 is now stabilized, thanks to great feedback from our beta
testers. We've also updated the C/C++ SDK, reinforcing our commitment to
openness and hackability so you can start experimenting and building
with the PGB-1 from day one.

Thanks for your patience and support. We can't wait to get the PGB-1 into your
hands!

# Production Resumes! (Apr 29, 2025)

We have great news from the test center: with the new Noise Nugget design, we
passed the EMC tests!

We immediately ordered a production batch of new Noise Nuggets. Once we receive
them, we will have to replace the old ones from the PGB-1 we already assembled,
and then we should able to ship the devices. We now hope that shipping can
start at the end of May.

In the meantime, here are two videos about an alternative firmware for the
PGB-1:

# Shipping Update! (Jun 24, 2025)

Hello everyone, quick update on the delivery. All the PGB-1 units are assembled
and ready to ship. Unfortunately we have yet another hurdle to pass. There are
a few requirements for the battery certification that we must resolve, and our
supplier promised us a solution in 2 to 3 weeks, so we should be able to ship
by the end of June!
