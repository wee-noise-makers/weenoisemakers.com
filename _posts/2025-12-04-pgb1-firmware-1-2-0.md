Hello everyone,

We are happy to announce a second firmware update for the PGB-1, with a few
quality-of-life improvements and new synth engines.

<!--more-->

[As explained for the first update](/blog/2025/08/24/pgb1-firmware-1-1-0.html),
use a good quality USB cable for the update, and do not interrupt the process.

# How to update

The new firmware is available from this link:

[PGB-1 Firmware v1.2.0](https://github.com/wee-noise-makers/WNM-PGB1-firmware/releases/download/v1.2.0/WNM-PGB1-firmware-1.2.0-release-20251203-1422.uf2)

And we have a video showing how to install it:

The biggest change in 1.2.0  is the ability to draw a single cycle waveform (Menu -> Custom Waveform) with the addition of many new synth engines using this user drawn waveform (see below). 

We also have a couple of  "Quality of Life" improvements:
 - Improved graphical interface with more icons in menus, and additional
   information for some settings
 - A chromatic keyboard (activated by holding the "Edit" button in track and
   step mode) to play the selected track and change the notes of the current
   step when in edit mode

The new sound engines are:
 - Kick Track
   - Sine Click Kick (similar to the Sine Kick with an additional noise transient)
   - Custom Waveform Kick
   - Custom Waveform Click Kick
 - Snare Track
   - Clap (high-pass)
   - Custom Waveform Snare  
 - Bass and Lead Tracks
   - Custom Waveform Glide
   - Custom Waveform Phaser
   - Custom Waveform Pluck
   - Custom Waveform Echo
   - Custom Waveform PDR (Phase Distortion Resonance) 
- Chord Tracks
   - Mixed Waveforms (each oscillator has a different waveform)
   - Custom Waveform

We also prepared a quick video to show how to transfer samples from your
computer to the PGB-1.
